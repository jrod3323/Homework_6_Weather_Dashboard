## Usage

This project is a Weather Dashborad. The tool is designed to provide the user with a means of reviewing the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast for the City of a User's choice.

A user will use the search fields in the aside to search for a City based on that Cities Name and Full State name.  

In the main data area, there is a jumbotron showing the searched for City and State as well as the date.  The current weather icon, temperature, wind speed and UV index will also be displayed.  The UV index will also be color coded based on a low, medium, or high index value.  

Below the main data area, the user will see a 5 day forecast for the given City that shows the date, weather icon, temperature and humidity for those days.  

Also, in the aside, there will be a list of most recent city searches.  This will populate up to 10 of the most recent searches from local storage.  If the user clicks one of these recent searches, the weather info for the City will be displayed. 

Also of note, on open, the user will be prompted with their most recent search.  If there are no recent searches in local storage, the user will see a jumbotron with the message " Please Choose A City To Display ".
